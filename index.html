		<h1>MEAN stack orientation help</h1>
		<p id="headeringress">
			Congratulations on starting your MEAN stack journey! We have MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js<br>...so far so good. But how to keep track of what they are and everything else. To start with, the order the names are presented in makes no sense to me. Therefore they will not be presented in MEAN order. I hope this page is going to help you cover some of the basics.

		<h2>The MEAN stack</h2>
		<p class="brodtext">The MEAN stack is a JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications. All components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, therefore MEAN stack applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.</p>

				<!-- NODE.JS -->
				<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="nodejs-button">Node.js (Server)</button>
				<div class="content">
  					<p><strong>Node</strong> is a JavaScript run-time environment. It allows us to write both server- and client-side JavaScript, and gives us the possibility to share code between client and server side (JavasScript end-to-end). Node can handle multiple web requests at the same time, they are all processed in the same thread (using a basic event model). One of Node&apos;s strengths is that it is fast to implement, both when it comes to installations and development.</p>

					<p>Make sure to install and run a stable version of Node when you develop. Usually even version numbers are stable.</p>

					<p>Node is open-source! It gives you the opportunity to install custom written modules/packages from other developers (3rd party packages). You&apos;ll use the Node Package Manager (npm) to install the packages. Please see below for Useful packages to use.</p>

					<p><strong>Connect</strong> is a HTTP server framework that allows you to use middleware. Learn more about Connect below under Useful packages.</p>

  					<p>Learn more in the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/" target="_blank">Node.js documentation</a></p>

				<!-- EXPRESS.JS -->
				<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="expressjs-button">Express.js (Server)</button>
				<div class="content">
  					<p>One of the most important custom packages to install with npm is <strong>Express</strong>. It is a web application framework (higher level framework that more or less extends and built upon Connect). Express acts as a light layer on top of Node, making it easier to develop Node web applications. It provides an easy-to-use API to interact with the webserver.</p>
					<p>Express also uses middleware. Middleware are used to modify request objects and response objects. They can either end an HTTP request or pass it along to another middleware, like a chain, with help from the next object.</p>

				<!-- Mongo DB -->
				<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="mongodb-button">MongoDB (Database)</button>
				<div class="content">
  					<p><strong>MongoDB</strong> is a document-oriented database (NoSQL). Unlike a relational database (SQL), it stores all information for a given object in a single instance in the database, and every stored object can be different from every other. This is suitable for a Node application and makes it a fast alternative for a database</p>
  					<p>Learn more in the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/" target="_blank">MongoDB documentation</a></p>
  					<!-- MONGO DB ATLAS -->
  					<button type="button" class="collapsible">MongoDB Atlas</button>
  					<div class="content">
  						<p><strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> is a cloud database service. In other words, this is where you can host your database and your data is stored here.</p>
						<p>This is a separate service and you&apos;ll have to create an account via their webpage to use it.</p>
  						<p>Learn more in the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/" target="_blank">MongoDB Atlas documentation</a></p>
  					</div>
  					<!-- MONGO DB COMPASS -->
  					<button type="button" class="collapsible">MongoDB Compass</button>
  					<div class="content">
  						<p><strong>MongoDB Compass</strong> is the GUI (graphical user interface) for MongoDB. In other words, it is an interactive tool for querying, optimizing, and analyzing your data.</p>
						<p>This is a separate application that you&apos;ll have to download and install to be able to run on your computer. You connect MongoDB Compass with your MongoDB Atlas. It is very visual and easy to use when working with your database.</p>

  					<!-- MONGOSH -->
  					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Mongosh</button>
  					<div class="content">
  						<p><strong>Mongosh</strong> is the MongoDB shell. It is an environment for interacting with the MongoDB deployment. The previous MongoDB shell was called only ‘mongo’.</p>
						<p>This is a command-line tool that can be installed from the MongoDB Atlas webpage (requires that you have Homebrew installed on your Mac). You connect your shell with your MongoDB Atlas.</p>

  					<button type="button" class="collapsible">Mongoose</button>
  					<div class="content">
  						<p><strong>Mongoose</strong> is built on top of the MongoDB driver and it is an object modeling tool. In other words, it provides you a way to model your data.</p>
						<p>You have to use 'npm install' to be able to use Mongoose on your computer.</p>

				<!-- ANGULAR.JS -->
				<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="angularjs-button">Angular.js (Web/Browser)</button>
				<div class="content">
  					<p><strong>Angular</strong> is a client-side JavaScript framework. It was developed to make it easy to well-designed and structures webpages and applications. Angular extends HTML attributes with help from ng-directives, and binds data to HTML elements using expressions {{ }}. Nice-to-know is that 'ng' is a core module of Angular.</p>
  					<p>Angular uses TypeScript (which is a superset of JavaScript) and the code is transpiled into JavaScript. To work with Angular directly from your command-line you can use<a href="https://angular.io/cli" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a>.</p>

				<div class="content">
  					<p><strong><a href="https://nodemon.io/" target="_blank">Nodemon</a></strong></p>
  					<p>Nodemon is a wrapper for Node. It allows you to keep your process up and running and automatically reloads it (restarts the server) for you when you save changes. This is perfect when you are developing and do not want to manually restart the server all the time. (When you have it installed and want to use it  you just replace node with nodemon in the command line.)</p>
  					<p><strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect" target="_blank">Connect</a></strong></p>
  					<p>Connect is a HTTP server framework that allows you to use middleware (so basically a middleware framework). Connect takes the built-in HTTP server functionality and extends it by adding a plugin framework. The plugins act as middleware. Middleware are really functions and they live between different layers in your application, and work like a hidden connection.</p>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="restapi-button">REST API</button>
				<div class="content">
  					<p><strong>REST API</strong> = Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. One way to put it is that an API lets you access data from an external source. You can for example access stored weather data via NASAs API. And then you can use that as input for your weather app. REST in itself is a software architectural style. Many APIs of today are of REST type.</p>
  					<p><strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a></strong> is an API platform for building and using APIs. It comes as an application and you can use it to test your Express REST API</p>
